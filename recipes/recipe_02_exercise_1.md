## 1. Describe the Problem

Count the number of words in a string.

## 2. Design the Function Signature

def count_words(string):
"""
Calculates the length of the string (number of words).

Parameters: string
returns: An integer, for the number of words in a string.

side effects: This function has no side effects.
"""
    pass
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._
```python
"""
Given a string with 2 words, will return 2.
"""

"""
Given a string with no words, will return 0.
"""

"""
Given a non-string, will return an error
"""

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

Written in test_count_words.py
