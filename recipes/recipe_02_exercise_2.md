## 1. Describe the Problem

To ensure proper sentence structure the sentence needs to start with a capital letter.
It also needs to end with proper punctuation such as . or ! or ?.

## 2. Design the Function Signature
```python
def sentence_checker(string):
"""
Returns True if the sentence is gramatically correct, and false if not.

Parameters: String

returns: Boolean

side effects: This function has no side effects
"""
    pass
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._
```python
"""
Given a sentence that starts with a capital letter and ends in a full stop.
"""

"""
Given a sentence that starts with a capital letter and ends in an exclamation mark!
"""

"""
Given a sentence that starts with a capital letter and ends in a lower case letter
"""

"""
Given a sentence that starts with a lowercase letter and ends in a question mark?
"""
"""
Given a sentence that starts with a full stop, has a capital letter and ends in a question mark?
"""
"""
Given a non-string, will return an error
"""

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour
